building image 
-------------
command: 

docker build -t testimage:1 . 

pieces: 

docker -> executes docker binary 
build -> builds an image 
-t -> don't worry about it lmao 
testimage -> image name 
:1 -> indicates version, if already exists will overwrite
. -> indicates to build the image in the CWD, will look here for docker file 



run image 
-------------
command: 

docker run -it testimage:1 

docker -> executes docker binary 
run -> runs an image 
-it -> interactive mode, input/output to terminal 
testimage:1 -> image name and version 



dockerfile structure 
----------------
FROM python:3.9
--> indicates what software we need on the image? 


RUN pip install pandas
--> will run as first step of our image


WORKDIR /app
--> creates and navigates to this location

COPY pipeline.py pipeline.py
--> copies file from CWD to WORKDIR (or CWD if not specified)'
--> first argument is local filename
--> second argument is what we name the file in the image


ENTRYPOINT [ "bash" ]
--> specifies the entrypoint of our image once built
--> in this case, because we specify
  we enter the image and are in a command shell
  that allows us to install pandas as first step
